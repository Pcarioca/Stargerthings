                            Jane "El" Hopper (born Jane Ives), better known as Eleven, is one of the main protagonists
                            of Stranger Things. Her character is portrayed by Millie Bobby Brown.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Eleven was kidnapped and raised in Hawkins National Laboratory, where she was experimented
                            on for her inherited psychokinetic abilities. After escaping the lab, she was found by Mike,
                            Lucas, and Dustin. Upon discovering her abilities, Mike believed that she could help find
                            Will, their missing friend. During their time together, she and Mike formed a strong bond
                            and quickly grew to like each other. It was ultimately revealed that, in a lab experiment,
                            she made contact with a creature from another dimension, accidentally opening an
                            inter-dimensional gateway. In an attempt to protect her friends, Eleven eventually faced and
                            destroyed this monster in a showdown at Hawkins Middle School, mysteriously vanishing in the
                            process.

                            William Jacob "Will" Byers, portrayed by Noah Schnapp, is a major protagonist in Stranger
                            Things. Will is the son of Lonnie and Joyce Byers and the younger brother of Jonathan Byers.
                            He is best friends with Mike Wheeler, Lucas Sinclair, Dustin Henderson, Eleven, and Max
                            Mayfield.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On the night of November 6th, 1983, Will was abducted by the Demogorgon and taken into an
                            alternate dimension dubbed the Upside Down. For a week, Will evaded the creature while his
                            family and friends desperately searched for him. Although he was eventually rescued and
                            returned to normal life, his time in the Upside Down left him with a mysterious connection
                            to the alternate realm.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            year later, Will became possessed by the Mind Flayer, becoming a part of his hive mind.
                            Through this connection, Will was able to understand the creature's motives and weaknesses.
                            However, the Mind Flayer exploited Will's connection to use him to massacre the scientists
                            at Hawkins National Laboratory. Finally, with the help of his mother and brother as well as
                            Nancy, the monster's possession over Will was alleviated and he returned safe and sound. A
                            month later, after being free from the Mind Flayer, Will attended the Snow Ball with his
                            friends but his mom still kept an eye on him to see if he was safe.

                            Dustin Henderson, portrayed by Gaten Matarazzo, is a major protagonist in the first three
                            seasons of Stranger Things. He is best friends with Mike Wheeler, Lucas Sinclair , Eleven,
                            Will Byers, and Max Mayfield.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 1983, when Dustin's friend, Will went missing, Dustin and the rest of his friends, Mike
                            and Lucas went out to look for him, only to find a mysterious girl named Eleven who had
                            telekinetic powers. Dustin had a neutral opinion of Eleven as she helped them look for Will,
                            but he became good friends with her after she saved him and Mike from being killed by their
                            school bullies. Dustin would continue to help his friends find Will and fight against a
                            Demogorgon until it was killed by Eleven. In the end, Dustin and his friends were reunited
                            with Will where they celebrated Christmas together.

                            In 1984, Dustin played a major role in the plot by discovering and raising D'Artagnan, which
                            he later discovered to be a juvenile demogorgon. He turned to Steve to deal with D'Artagnan,
                            and later joined forces with the rest of the gang to save Will and all of Hawkins. He, along
                            with Steve and his friends, assisted in burning the expanding network of the Mind Flayer,
                            providing a distraction while Eleven closed the Gate for good. A month later, Dustin attends
                            his school's Snow Ball in the hopes of impressing Max Mayfield, but is disappointed when she
                            and Lucas become a couple. However, he dances with Mike's older sister, Nancy, saying he'll
                            one day win a girl's heart.

                            Joyce Byers, portrayed by Winona Ryder, is a major protagonist in Stranger Things. The
                            financially poor single mother of Will and Jonathan Byers, Joyce works as a retail clerk and
                            relies on help from her eldest to make ends meet.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After Will mysteriously disappeared, Joyce was certain that he was communicating with her
                            through the lights in her house. Despite everyone treating her as if she was having a mental
                            breakdown, Joyce refused to believe that Will was dead, even after his alleged corpse was
                            found. Through co-operation with her friend and local police chief Jim Hopper, Will’s
                            friends, and Jonathan, she eventually uncovered the circumstances of her son’s disappearance
                            and entered the Upside Down to rescue him.

                        <p>
                            A year after the mysterious tragedy of her son, Joyce helps her son with another issue
                            following the events of the first season as she begins dating her old classmate Bob Newby
                            until his death. Towards the end, she, Jonathan, and Nancy assisted in removing Will from
                            the possession of the Mind Flayer.
